Prerequisites:

Install Node.js version 7.5 (should include npm during installation)
Install MongoDB

How to use MongoDB:
    Start the mongod service:
        Open a cmd window inside the bin folder for MongoDB (e.g. "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin")
        Type: mongod.exe
            Optional: By default, the service will look at \data\db\ on the root folder for database files, so to change it
                      add --dbpath to the command (e.g mongod.exe --dbpath "Drive:\your\choosen\location")
        This cmd window must stay running to use the database
    
    Playing around with the database:
        In the same bin folder, but in a different cmd window:
        Type: mongo.exe

        Basic commands:
            show dbs - shows databases in database system
            use <database name> - create/switch to database
            db - show current database
            show collections - shows the collections/tables of the database
            db.<collection name>.find() - shows all the entries in the collection/table
            db.<collection.name>.drop() - deletes the collection and all its entries

How to set up our application (so far):
    To gather application dependencies:
        Open a new cmd window in the same directory as the "package.json" file
        Type: npm install
            This should install all dependencies listed in the "package.json" file

    To start server:
        In a cmd window at the same directory as above
        Type: node server.js
            Alternatively: type npm start
                This will execute  the start script defined in the "package.json" file
        This cmd window must stay running to use web server

    To run sample (client.js):
        Open a new cmd window in the same directory
        Type: node client.js

    USEFUL INFO:
        The application should automatically create a database called aya
        The poll infomation should then be found in the polls collection of the aya database (i.e. db.polls.find())
